## My process

### Built with

- Designed by Figma
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Resiponsive design
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I Learned

1. How to combine Flexbox with `ul` and `ol` to control layout spacing while preserving native list markers.
2. How to use pseudo-classes (e.g. `::marker`) to style `ul` and `ol` without breaking their semantics.
3. How to design different layouts for desktop and mobile to improve responsiveness and readability.
