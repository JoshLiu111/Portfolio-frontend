## My process

### Built with

- Designed by Figma
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

**Reading and translating Figma designs into code**  
 I learned how to properly read Figma designs (layout, spacing, typography, and states) and translate them into clean, well-structured HTML and CSS. This helped me build layouts that closely match the design while keeping the code organized and maintainable.

**Importing and using local fonts with `@font-face`**  
 I learned how to load a locally downloaded variable font using `@font-face`, define weight ranges, and apply the font consistently across the project instead of relying on external CDNs.

**Building tag-style components with `inline-flex`**  
 I revisited how to use a `<span>` as a tag/label and style it with `display: inline-flex` to control alignment, spacing, and padding, making the tag content visually balanced and easier to manage.

### Continued development

**Write more efficient and scalable CSS**  
 I want to continue improving how I structure CSS by reducing repetition, grouping shared styles, and making better use of reusable patterns (such as utility classes and CSS variables).
